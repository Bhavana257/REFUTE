# REFUTE

A reasoning system that challenges user answers through adversarial logic and only accepts them once they withstand counter arguments and edge cases.

## What It Does
REFUTE analyzes user provided answers and actively attempts to disprove them by:
- Exposing hidden assumptions
- Generating counter examples
- Testing logical consistency

## Why It Exists
Most AI systems agree too easily. REFUTE is built to disagree, so better answers survive.

## Tech Stack
- Gemini 3 API
