# REFUTE

**REFUTE** is an adversarial reasoning engine that challenges user-provided claims using structured logic and counter-arguments.  
Instead of validating answers by default, REFUTE actively attempts to disprove them and only accepts responses that withstand multiple rounds of logical stress testing.

## 1. What REFUTE Does

REFUTE analyzes user-provided claims, solutions, or responses and applies adversarial reasoning to evaluate their validity.  
The system attempts to refute inputs by:

1. Exposing hidden assumptions  
2. Generating counterexamples and edge cases  
3. Identifying logical inconsistencies and contradictions  

Only when a response survives several rounds of examination does REFUTE issue an **acceptance verdict**, accompanied by a **step-by-step logical justification**.

## 2. Why REFUTE Exists

Most AI systems prioritize agreement, often producing confident but incorrect answers.  
REFUTE is designed to do the opposite.

By deliberately **disagreeing first**, REFUTE helps users strengthen their reasoning, identify weaknesses, and arrive at more robust and defensible conclusions.

## 3. How It Works

1. A user submits a claim or response through the frontend interface.  
2. The backend constructs an adversarial prompt and sends it to the **Gemini 3 API**.  
3. Gemini 3 analyzes the input and returns a **structured JSON response** containing:
   - Verdict  
   - Supporting arguments  
   - Counter-arguments  
   - Step-by-step reasoning  
4. The backend validates and parses the response before presenting the results to the user in a clear, structured format.

This architecture ensures that AI reasoning remains **controlled, explainable, and auditable**.

## 7. Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for REFUTE include:

1. Scoring responses based on reasoning strength  
2. Domain-specific reasoning modes (education, software design, policy analysis)  
3. Collaborative debate support for evaluating multiple claims simultaneously
